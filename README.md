# Data science portfolio by Marc Plunkett


This is a repository of the projects I worked on or currently are working on.

The projects are written in Python (Jupyter Notebook) and the general goal of each project is to use data science/statistical modelling to find an interesting trend which could be used to influence some sort of decision by giving an actionable insight.

A typical project consist of the following steps:

* Sourcing and cleaning data
* Analysis which involves model selection, training and testing 
* Visualization of the results 
* Conclusion
